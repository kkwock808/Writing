Winter in Europe can be charming. From Christmas markets to New Year's celebrations, Europe combats the dreary cold with all the jovial spirit that comes with the month of December. However, this winter, I chose not to partake in Christmas and New Year celebrations and spent roughly 3.5 weeks in Southern Africa, exploring Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Zambia. My adventure here was filled with eye-opening experiences that no other trip could capture in such a short time period.

## Namibia – Sossuvlei, Swakopmund, Damaraland, Etosha, Okonjima, Windhoek

Roughly 2 million people live in Namibia, yet the country itself is larger than the state of Texas. With all the sparsely populated Namibian land, Namibia makes for a great self-guided road trip. 

Our first stop, Sossusvlei, is a picturesque landscape that is a common screensaver for many computers. Deadvlei, where bare branches of camel thorn trees rest against the red backdrop of rolling sand dunes, was a magical place to visit simply because it is a record of a prehistoric river that once flowed here.

Close by, Big Daddy is the largest dune in Sossuvlei (and in the world!), and climbing this sandy trek at 10 am in the morning was no easy feat. The temperatures rose early in the morning, and the air was thin in this part of the desert. However, the views from the top of the dunes were glorious. Up here, red meets blue, and the visage of dunes after dunes was simply stunning to witness.

In Swakopmund, Namibians could be seen enjoying their holidays by the beachside. Though smaller than Windhoek, Swakopmund and Walvis Bay appear to be the vacation destinations for Namibians across the country. Here, we toured Sandwich Harbor and all the fascinating natural scenery that comes with it. The most spectacular part of the tour (sorry, Flamingo Bay, Kuiseb Delta, Salt Flats, etc.) was the coastlines. Here, sprawling dunes suddenly meet the ocean, creating a scenic backdrop on a nice, sunny day.

Continuing our exploration, I really wanted to understand the native plant species that accompanied the climate in this area. Here, we embarked on the Welwitschia Drive just outside Swakopmund. We were able to hit all 13 landmarks on this tour, and some of the most fascinating aspects of this are below:

The biggest Welwitschia there is!

We then stopped by Spitzkoppe. Spitzkoppe here has been revered by climbers as a tough mountain to scale. The smooth granite facade of Spitzkoppe is what gives the mountain its fame despite its relative height being much less than nearby mountains, like the Brandberg Mountains. Here, we toured the famous arch and explored the area briefly before heading towards Damaraland.

In Damaraland, we didn't really do much but relax in the comforts of our newly constructed, 4-star lodge. The only activity we partook in, and despite the apprehension, the elephant tours and the Twyfelfontein bushmen paintings ended up being the highlights. Here, desert elephants acclimated to the relatively higher altitudes and different terrain of Damaraland.

The Twyfelfontein bushmen paintings here highlight the mystique and shaman-like figures bushmen worshipped when they still lived here many centuries ago. The lionman painting here suggests that in bushmen lore, a shaman that appeared as a lionman (with a long tail) would guide bushmen towards water springs and bountiful hunting areas. Revered as a powerful individual, the lion man also had healing capabilities. Our tour guide here was extremely engaging and also showed us the native click language of the Damara people. Super cool!

In Okaukuejo, the largest waterhole in Etosha, we opted for a self-drive safari of the low-lying salt pan nearby. Thankfully, the safari gods were watching over us, and out in the distance, we spotted what looked like a rhino! Since it was summer, animals were dispersed across the park and not confined to the waterholes as they normally would be during the winter season when fresh drinking water was scarce. 

<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/4/4_etosha.jpeg">

For a part of our Etosha tour, we visited Onguma, unfortunately, the weather was not cooperative on this side of the park. The heavy rains made for a not-so-spectacular safari drive, but the accommodation was perfect.

<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/4/4_onguma.jpeg">

Here, near the end of our trip, we visited a nonprofit, the Okonjima Cheetah Reserve in Otjiwarongo, to understand the mission work of many different nonprofits in the area. We learned that most conservation efforts today in Namibia are centered on education and youth for change. In the past, Okonjima would be able to foster cheetahs and other animals that have fallen out of their natural habitat, but because of governmental regulations, laws, and other conservation strategies, Okonjima can no longer do that. Furthermore, what was starkly different in Namibia was the growing population of poultry farmers in the country, leading to increased habitat loss and animal encroachment onto their territories. This is why new strategies to educate farmers against shooting wild safari animals are needed. 

The few cheetahs that are fostered here were majestic to witness close up. They are familiar with humans and pose no threat, yet being up close to a predator made us feel insignificant!

Our last activity in Namibia was the Waterberg Recreation Area. Here, we opted for a short hike in the area and were greeted with lush greenery, a viewpoint, and scenes of an African monsoon in the distance. This calmed me down because I realized we were more than halfway through our Africa trip!

## South African Diaries – Garden Route

Once landing in Cape Town, we were greeted with a relaxing coolness in the air. The weather was a crisp 70º, with humidity levels hovering around 60\%. Ahhh, it was a delight to be in this climate after Namibia. We weren’t in Cape Town for too long, but the activities we did do here were the Chapman's Peak Drive, Kirstenbosch National Forest, and Lion’s Head Hike. Some snippets below highlight the amazing scenery of KaapStaad!

On our way out of Cape Town, it is important to note that much of apartheid rule has been dismantled by now, but the effects of a race-based society still clawed at the fabric of South African society. The townships and visible economic disparities we noticed on our drive out of Cape Town indicated that much of South Africa has not turned over a new leaf; in fact, they were undergoing a glacial transition to a more integrated and equitable country. 

We took Clarence Drive while en route to De Hoop, which brought us up and down the spiraling coastlines of South Africa. Upon arriving at De Hoop, we were able to check out the De Hoop nature reserve, including Koppie Alleen and its wonderful tidepools. Additionally, since we were close to the southernmost tip of Africa, we checked out the lighthouse in the area as well, the Cape L'Agulhas Lighthouse. 

<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/4/4_clarence.jpeg">

<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/4/4_agulhas.jpeg">

From De Hoop to Knysna, we took the Malgas crossing, which was a unique ferry designed for private vehicles crossing a small river. While the river was nothing to gawk at, the fact my hatchback rental was able to get on/off the ferry unscratched from all the gravel and mud was shocking. This was a delight.

<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/4/4_malgas.jpeg">

When we got to Knysna, we were greeted with a geological wonder. The Knysna lagoon is insulated from rough ocean waters and guarded by the East and West Heads of the bay. Here, we did the Featherbed Reserve Tour, showcasing the amazing ecological diversity on West Head. Here, we learned that natural fires are actually encouraged to stimulate the growth and replacement of fynbos (fine bush or South African shrubbery). Additionally, the Knysna Loerrie is a species of turaco bird that only exists in this region of South Africa. On a nice, calm day, one should be able to hear the Knysna Loerrie.

South Africa is also known for its tea exports, particularly, the rooibos tea (red bush). Thankfully, I got my hands on a few of these before leaving. 

One of the mornings from Knysna to Tsitsikamma Nature Reserve, we wanted to tour a peninsula (Robberg Nature Reserve) located near Plettenberg Bay. Here, we were greeted with jaw-dropping visuals of a nature reserve that housed seagull nests, seals, whale sightings, and a ring trail that took you around the island.

Another fascinating aspect of South Africa is the microclimate. Up until now we drove along the coast and witnessed cloudy weather and cool humidity. On the portions of the drive where we leave the coastlines, sunny weather, and drier climates become the norm. On our way to Tsitsikamma, nestled at the foot of the Tsitsikamma mountains, it is no wonder that farmers enjoy this region of South Africa for its potential to house agriculture farms. Our Airbnb in Tsitsikamma made me wish for simpler times...

<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/4/4_microclimate.jpeg">

<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/4/4_suspension.jpeg">

In Tsitsikamma, we visited the suspension bridge hike that is infamous for its sway. On the way, we also decided to check out the viewpoint to see a stunning view of the Eastern Cape of South Africa. 

While this was the farthest we went on the garden route, we have no doubt that Port Elizabeth and further would’ve been exciting to do. But as we were on a time crunch, we decided to boomerang back to Cape Town, with a one-night stay in Oudtshoorn

Oudtshoorn itself was a town with a fascinating history. Colloquially known in South Africa as the Ostrich Capital of the World, Oudtshoorn was a town the elites lived in during the peak of the ostrich trade. Here, houses in the style of art nouveau dominated the main street of Oudtshoorn. When the industry left, Oudtshoorn then became a town like most other towns in South Africa, but sightings of Ostrich farms and Ostrich paraphernalia were an echo from the past, calling to the extreme fortunes Oudtshoorn once had. 

<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/4/4_oudtshoorn.jpeg">

On our way back to Cape Town, we visited a waterfall and learned that the reason for South Africa's biodiversity and geological richness is due to the formation of the African continent after breaking away from Pangea. South Africa is nestled in the fertile valley of two continents, and rock formations point to the point in time when Pangea split up. Furthermore, because of the geological formations, like mountains and rolling valleys, biodiversity was able to flourish with the different climate pockets thriving along the coastline. 

<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/4/4_waterfall.jpeg">

Back in Cape Town, we visited Kirstenbosch National Forst, which capped our visit with a tour of the different cycads, pincushions, reed plants, and fynbos South Africa offers. A plate in the national forest said that up to 4000 species of plants exist in South Africa and nowhere else.

**Favorite Food Alert**: Cape Town is known particularly for its fish. The Hake and Linefish are the most commonly eaten fish here. Here, at a meal back in Cape Town, I had a Seafood platter, and I swear, I thought the calamari was shaped like the thick french fries I'd get in Belgium.

## Zimbabwe/Zambia – Victory lap at Victoria Falls

Perhaps the most peculiar thing I noticed once landing in Zimbabwe was the immigration officer requesting \$30 to print my single-entry visa. This took me for a spin since I barely remembered the 2009 collapse of the Zimbabwean dollar and the subsequent recognition of the US dollar as the national currency. Furthermore, what is even more interesting is the lack of any smaller denominations than the \$1 bill, as my Canadian friend pointed out. This is bizarre and highly unusual since the cost of living in Zimbabwe is nowhere near the levels of the US, so coins and quarters should be more commonly used here because of relatively cheaper goods. 

Victoria Falls in January, after the calm of Spring but before the Summer’s storms. Victoria Falls is best known for the span of its waterfall. Being the world’s widest waterfall, I was smitten to witness such a natural wonder in all of its seasonal prime. 

<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/4/4_vicfalls.jpeg">

Torrential-like streams in Victoria Falls are common in the periods of late summer to fall. We are now in mid-summer, where rainfall is increasing by the day. The rivers are brackish and the skies are often riddled with thunderheads. We were also about to do the Devil’s Pool, and luckily, we were able to take a dip before it closed for the season. 

<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/4/4_vicfalls1.jpeg">

Here I was, getting a mouthful of brackish water from the Zambezi River. Also, hippo sightings are common on this river, MEANING I’ve successfully inhaled hippo poop water. Yikes.

## Conclusion

Africa was majestic. It was gorgeous, grand, and ever-lasting. Natural landscapes and plant species have existed here for thousands of years in the hardened, raw African continent. My 3.5-week vacation ends here, but I am leaving this trip with a renewed appreciation for the world and the beauty it encompasses, especially the often underappreciated marvels of a continent far away from the creature comforts of the developed world. 

Cheers and until next time, my friends.
