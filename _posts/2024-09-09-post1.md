## Introduction

Hello! My name is Kevin, and I will blog about my exchange program in Belgium. This blog is sponsored by the generous Bonenfant International Travel Scholarship, a grant opportunity that Optica manages. Without their support, I would not have been able to afford to complete my interest in working abroad for a year.

## Pre-Travel Thoughts

Having never been to the European hemisphere, I was excited for all that COULD happen this year. It will be busy, tiring, and exhilarating. Not many get to spend a year working abroad as a researcher on a scholarship. Science remains one of the more global careers today. I am thankful for today's international scientific scene, motivating me to become a postdoctoral scholar at Ghent University for at least one year.

Initially, I had planned to move to the West Coast to search for a more industry-oriented job, but I could not say no to this opportunity, even if it meant delaying life and my plans. Friends in Europe that I've made over the past six years in NYC await me in Europe, and I could not have been happier with the timing of this opportunity. 

Things I look forward to learning more about are the cultural landmarks of the Old World, the dynamism between different European states, and the scientific communities of Europe. Of course, all I know to this date is the United States, so I will have to baseline many of my European experiences with my native experiences as a US national…

## Taking off: Skipping across the pond with a pit stop in Iceland

How about starting my study abroad with a pre-trip??? One of my nearest and dearest buddies from high school, Scott, wanted to check out the stunning volcanic scenery of Iceland in summer. Here, for six days, we zoomed through Reykjavik and quickly headed North to the historic fishing village of Brimsellvir.

Something was enchanting about this moment: it was as if a path of dandelions formed to guide my steps right up to this cliff that points directly to the midnight sun.

Along the way, waterfalls at every inch of Iceland w. Contrasting this with my upbringing in Hawaii, where waterfalls only stream down the Kaneohe mountainside during severe thunderstorms, here, waterfalls were a dime a dozen. Take your pick; you are guaranteed an Instagrammable location…

The waterfalls with the highest foot traffic are the Gulfoss and Skogafoss waterfalls. These two waterfalls are constantly full, with almost a 100-foot drop from the top. Tourists like myself can walk behind or close to the waterfall's end and drench themselves in the cold, 50º water. Yet, here we were, soaked with the dewey droplets of Skogafoss.

One of the cultural sites we visited was Skaholt. Skaholt boasts a historical church like many Iceland towns. Still, this town was significant because it had politically and culturally consequential activity, such as organizing the first Icelandic clergy school, from the Middle Ages to the present. The church hosts visitors for tours of its underground museum and the adjacent ruins of its first inhabitants. All-around interesting!

Puffins. Among seagulls, arctic terns, and swans, the puffins were among the more fascinating avians in the Icelandic landscapes. Puffins are stout-looking birds with bright orange-colored beaks. They fly in bizarre, quick flaps, unlike their more extended wingspan cousins, the seagulls. 
While most wildlife fled from us, the puffins were naturally curious, and I am happy to say I've got a selfie with these fascinating buggahs.

**Favorite Food Alert**: Icelandic Hot Dog. No ketchup involved. Only beef or lamb. Your choice!

## Arrival in Continental Europe

Some of the first thoughts I had while sitting on the Intercity Rail between Brussels and Ghent were population sizes. Albuquerque, New Mexico's population is ~700,000, and NYC's daytime population is ~10 million. Ghent's population is ~500,000, close to Albuquerque, but highly concentrated around the city center. The younger-aged crowd in Ghent also draws parallels to a modern US college town, like Boulder, Colorado, and Austin, Texas. Yet, the compact, communal living means students and residents of Ghent don't own cars or homes with sprawling lawns. Instead, bikes and the US equivalent of townhouses are typical in a Ghent resident's life. 

One Friday in particular, on a sun-filled afternoon, Stijn and his buddies invited me for BBQ. Good weather is rare in Belgium. But good, sunny, and warm weather? Even more rare. It was just great to reconnect with old friends and new friends, all under the auspices of a warm summer's eve…

## Work/Research Highlights

During my first week here, I expected visa troubles to be the least of my concerns. Having received the long-term D visa, I could enter the country, but it seems that to work here, I also needed a work permit. Encountering this minor hiccup, BAEF and UGent are working to temporarily put me as an exchange Ph.D. student before moving on to postdoc status later. 

My work will be headquartered in the Photonics Hub on UGent's Zwijnaarde campus. Bicycles are the norm here, so it took about 20 minutes to get from Gint-St. Pieters station to work (not bad at all!). When I rolled into the lab spaces to meet with my professor, I was pleasantly greeted by the collaborative space the Photonics Research Group occupied. Here, folks were interested in developing all there is to Silicon Photonics, and I am excited to get my hands dirty to learn what I can during this year.

## 2024 Olympics

There has been some buzz about the 2024 Olympics being the best time to visit Paris. During my time there, the restaurants lining the streets were underwhelmingly quiet despite the occasional cheers of 'Allez les bleus' from dedicated fans. The trains were not as crowded as a typical Parisian day. Overall, it was quite a pleasant experience since I expected a NYC not-your-friend attitude towards tourists like myself. Safety in the city was top-notch; while armed guards patrolling every other street did not fit with the French's 'Liberty, Equality, Fraternity' attitude, it nonetheless brought a sense of calm to an anxious city actively hosting the world's premier athletic event.

Beach Volleyball was particularly rowdy because a pair of French players were eliminated during our round. Welp!

Hexagonal streets, roundabouts, red chimneys, black roofs, white facades, and outward-facing restaurant tables can all capture Paris' aesthetic. Furthermore, the immense dedication and true-to-nature of Paris' art scene can be captured by large Louvre museum (which I'm told, can be 3x as big as the MET in NYC!) The Hall of Statues was where I spent the most time. Truly a wonder to witness in person.

**Favorite Food Alert**: French Onion Soup. 
Speaking of food, I have not seen a single rat. I was hoping for a Ratatouille-esque encounter, but Paris 2024 cleaned up nicely!

## Antwerpen and Brussels

Antwerpen was THE central port city of the Dutch back in the heyday. Because of this role, Antwerp residents were often associated with the bourgeoisie because of the supposed 'posh' Dutch accents. Anyways, the charming coastal city felt much larger than Ghent, probably because of the wider roads, the taller buildings, the larger population (~2x larger than Ghent), and the very noticeable diversity. Here, I was visiting Yarne, who was set to play in a band reunion at the Wilrock community festival. The festival gathered the city's metal bands into a weekend of fun! Coming from a reggae-oriented, chill music listener, I found metal certainly refreshing!

My visit to Brussels was particularly timely. The Assumption of Mary was a federal holiday, and to commemorate this event, Brussels decorated the plaza in front of the Grand Place with a giant flower carpet. The carpet itself was large and, I could swear, almost the size of a track field.

## Gouda is Gucci and Touring the Baltic Gatekeepers

As they all say, friendships that last longer than six years are probably friendships for life. Years had nothing against Jean and Sander (and Christina!), friends I met in 2018 during the first year of my PhD. Here we were, enjoying the canals of Amsterdam during the busy museum days we had planned.

There's also a harpsichord sighting at the Rijksmuseum!

**Favorite Food Alert**: A savory pineapple chicken pancake. This reminded me very much of a chinese omelette! But no egg was involved, interestingly...

Tallinn itself captures an astonishingly large part of European history that I did not learn. Having been conquered by the Vikings, the Danes, the Swedes, and the Soviet Union, the history of Estonia itself is a story of resistance and identity. Religious orthodoxy undertones, castles, and brutalism pepper the landscape of Tallinn also. Additionally, Czar Peter I called Tallinn his summer home and I can certainly see the aesthetic of a charming Baltic port city for a summer getaway...

**Favorite Food Alert**: Duck Pelmeni. I couldn't taste the duck, but truthfully speaking, I'd give any dumplings a 10/10 rating. 

<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/1_pelmeni.jpeg">

Hopping onwards, I took the Eckero Ferry from Tallinn to Helsinki. Upon arrival, the Finns had a similar vibe but a rather distinct modern tone to its cityscape. Jugendstil buildings were the common norm and, from my limited understanding of architecture history, consisted of big arches, rounded towers, and blocky facades. 

Alvar Aalto, the eminent Finnish architect of the 20th century, loved the use of organic elements in his works. I visited both his studio and home to witness the artistic use of wood and light in his everyday life. His aesthetic is one I would like to mimic in my future home!

**Favorite Food Alert**: At around 7 pm, near the Kauppatori Marketplace, vendors would always be getting rid of food for lower prices. Here, I got a salmon plate with a hot dog for 20 euros! Truly a delicious steal!
