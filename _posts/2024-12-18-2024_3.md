This is a shorter post so that I can keep up with the blogging! I don’t plan on going home since home is nearly halfway across the globe for me, notwithstanding the cost of flights during the holiday season. But do not fear; there’s more than enough to keep me busy this coming break! 

Some reflections on what I’ve been up to lately:

## Proposal Writing

With all the free-form schedules and work-life choices you can receive as an academic, the uncertainty of what/where your next research job is also part of this life as well. Knowing that I had about a year since October to stay in Belgium, I had to quickly figure out an exit plan or a continuation plan for my time here. 

Last month, proposal writing dominated most of my free time at work. The postdoctoral fellowships available in Belgium were three-year-long appointments. Still, applicants had to prepare a 10-page research proposal and a detailed research plan to be selected. Unlike some of the fellowship applications I’ve prepared for US institutions, my impression is that European applications tend to be more extensive in the application process. Some components included a 10-page proposal, a personal statement, one recommendation letter, a data management plan, and a series of essay-style questions about leadership. Irrespective of the outcome, here’s to hoping for a positive reception of my proposal!

## Travel Bits–Pre-Christmas in Cologne

A week before Thanksgiving, I decided to visit Cologne and its Christmas Markets. The first day I arrived, I quickly did a speed run through all the Christmas markets (which included at least 5). Coming from super-duper turbo-charged consumer-ish Christmas markets in NYC, Cologne was a bit more homier. Friends and family members would drink and eat out at the table areas. To some extent, it was more of a food market with some shopping, whereas, in NYC, it was more of shopping with some food options.

However, situated in the heart of Cologne, one will notice the Cologne Cathedral, the single most dominating structure in the German city. The Gothic structure was constructed during the Medieval age. On a calm Sunday, I also witnessed a commemorative event for firefighters across Germany. 

Lastly, the Lindt Chocolate Factory was a special highlight of my visit. Here, the manufacturing process, environmental effects, and Meso-American history of chocolate were well-imparted onto casual goers like myself. Caught between my allegiance to Belgian chocolate and the Lindt Chocolate Factory, I could appreciate the overall museum because of the spectacular peek I got of industrialized chocolate. Truly a splendid tour!

**Favorite Food Alert**: This pork loin sandwich/burger from the Christmas market. It was just simply juicy and delicious.

## Catching the Northern Lights

One place I wanted to check out was the world's northernmost city of Tromø in Norway. On December 13, 2024, Tromsø was precisely on a polar night. The faintest sun rays barely reached Tromsø from 9 am to about 2 pm before the polar darkness came again. One of the first things I did was to embark on the Fjellheisen cable car to check out the city views.

Feeling spontaneous as usual, I wanted to try hiking up Mt. Floya but had to quickly rethink that idea because I did not have shoe clamp-ons to scale the icy hills. Regardless, I was surrounded by tranquility while I marched down the hill.

Another astonishing exhibit, free for students like myself, was the Polarmuseet. Tromsø was founded in the 1800s, at the height of the hunting of walruses, seals, whales, and foxes in the artic. The museum captures the exciting and usually dangerous foray into the hunting and civilian life of 1800 Tromsø. Furthermore, efforts to reach the North Pole were being explored at this point, with fascinating documentation of air balloons, ships, and kayaks to sail the North Pole. I was barely making it in -12ºC weather with my coat, gloves and boots; I cannot imagine the burden people living here in the 1800s felt.

For lunch one day, I wanted to try out fish and chips at a local eatery. I knew I shouldn’t have claimed the table of 4 since we were roughly entering peak lunch hour, and I was about to get booted from my seat. 

However, unexpectedly, a woman walked towards my table, all flustered and looking for seats. Instead of booting me, she asked if she and her husband, who was coming, could join me. Since I was in the wrong here, why not? Next thing you know, she came back with wine and two glasses, and we were saying ‘Skøl’ (cheers in Norwegian) and talking about life in Tromsø. It was unplanned, but small moments like this made me appreciate the unpredictable and often surprising parts of traveling alone.

Finally, my true purpose for visiting Tromsø was to check out the Northern Lights.

Though weather conditions and solar activity were not optimal during this visit, I am glad to have visited life in the world's northernmost city. It was pleasant despite the many feet of snow and frigid winds.

**Favorite Expereince Alert!** Watching Anora, an indie movie, in a movie theater built in 1916.

## Ghent Christmas Market

The Ghent Christmas Market is likely the coolest thing happening in town. The most shocking thing about this establishment is the differences between German and Belgian Christmas markets. In Germany, BBQ pits and shops that cater to your average family’s shopping needs are typical. In Belgium, you will instead find dance floors and skating rinks in the middle of the markets. Daunting. But wait until I tell you about the closing hours. Unlike the rest of the Christmas markets I visited, Ghentians shutter their Christmas shops at 1 am. Ghentians, especially the college-aged ones, live up to their typical party-goers and cater to that particular trope. Interesting.

## Dutch A1 

Recently, I also finished my first foreign language course. Whether or not I take Dutch Pt. 2 will depend on my exam results…

A few of my colleagues from Dutch class are pictured here!
