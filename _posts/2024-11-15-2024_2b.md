## One last move for a while

Another big chapter this month was moving! Moving is never fun, but I did this about three or four times in the past 3 months, so yeah, living out of a suitcase is starting to get to me. Thankfully, Ghent has an IKEA, thrift shops, and more permanent accommodation on the city's north side. At Huidevetterken, I will lay low for a bit and hopefully move into more relaxing, permanent housing.

Ward, my new roommate, has two ADORABLE cats, Malouti and Levi, so I guess this is the year I also become a co-parent/co-babysitter/housemate/roomie to a pair of furry friends that I have only heard good stories about. And boy! Am I growing up fast? Haha, it was not that long ago when I was still in school, and BOOM, now I’ve got two more housemates to share my time in Ghent with.

For my birthday, I threw a housewarming/Halloween joint dinner party. It was nice seeing all the familiar faces and new ones in a foreign country. I’m thankful for all the people who have positively enriched my stay here in Belgium. Hopefully the dinner parties can continue, perhaps bigger and more festive, but please check in on that as well. A ‘gezellig’ start is how I shall start my stay in this beautiful, new house.

## Disaster on the bike

On an unlucky ride back, I got into a biking accident (that was entirely not my fault, though my clumsy reaction time did its worst) and had to go to the hospital. Thankfully, everything was taken care of by the insurance I was placed on and the hospital visit resulted in nothing more than a few steri-strips on my eye (no stitches, yay!).

In the future, I'll have to be more wary about biking since this is one of the few close calls I've had since getting to Belgium!

## Les Nederlands

‘Ik ben Kevin en ik vind Nederlands MOEILIJK’ is what's playing on repeat in my head every time I finish class. Though Dutch is hard, I find it gratifying that immigrants and students across Ghent enroll in night classes to learn a language in a country that will soon become their home. Many of my classmates here are looking to pass the citizenship exam, and the Dutch class was the only thing to check off before embarking on that process.

Part of me felt a bit of nostalgia on my mom's part since I remember her early days of learning English in a foreign environment to pass her citizenship test in the US. That part of me also could empathize with the struggles of newly-arrived immigrants and their need to integrate and learn the language of their host country. It wasn't hard for me since the class was taught in English. Compared to my mom's English class, her instruction was not in chinese, making it harder... I'm thankful I speak English and am grateful for the seamless lessons I have received in Dutch so far.

## Witnessing (the end of) history(?): Election 2024. 

On a more somber note, the recent US election, while being an entire clown show from the beginning, was distressing to witness from abroad. During one of my visits to the hospital the morning after (or the evening in US time), every single TV blared the results of the election, to much dismay. I felt embarrassed speaking English to the nurses since I immediately got associated with a country that had elected a controversial, incompetent leader, TWICE.

However, I strongly believe in the American democratic system. It has its faults, and most of the time makes its errors, but it is inherently self-correcting. The elections might've bruised the great American project of 200+ years in history-making, but it will not collapse it. There is much to be optimistic about, and right now, I'm already feeling motivated for the 2026 midterm election, which will be a reflection of what Americans voted for in 2024. 

2024 was an election run on misinformation, and I can only hope and pray that its veil of deceit will reveal itself over the next two years...
