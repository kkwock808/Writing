## Research

Now that I have settled comfortably into Ghent, some of the projects I hope to take on this year in the Photonics Research Group (PRG) are centered around nanophotonic sciences:

Project 1: Identification and study of cleanroom-processed TMDs
	TMDs are fascinating 2D materials, mainly because of their strong luminescent properties in the visible, making TMDs ideal ‘reporters’ of nanoscale fluctuations in the local environment. Thankfully, Prof. Alberto Curto in the PRG, leading a research group on 2D material photonics, has the tools and equipment for me to carry out these studies on cleanroom processed TMDs for pixel sensors. Stay tuned!

Project 2: Integrated UCNP nonlinear lasers
	UCNPs are nonlinear materials that absorb infrared photons to emit visible photons very efficiently. Here, I’m trying to see how I can integrate these stellar materials into silicon photonic systems. I am working with Prof. Kasper van Gasse, an expert in integrated lasers, to push these nanoparticles toward the next frontiers in chip-based nanophotonics.

Proposal Writing: I am writing a series of postdoctoral fellowship applications to cover my bases after my fully funded year abroad in Belgium to continue funding the work I have started in Belgium. Proposal writing is never fun, but I’ve gotten used to it; it has become routine as a budding scientist. Whether or not they’ll land, I must put in the work and hope for the best.

## Travel Bits–Santorini

That is all to say that while my time has been busy, I’ve never forgotten my insatiable need to travel. In September, I had to skip Greece, Switzerland, and Portugal to visit my friends who were passing through the continent. In November, I had the opportunity to travel to Luxembourg as well. Thematically, I can recount the past few months as the months I visited UNESCO sites across several countries.

In Greece, I met up with Donovan, who was coming in from a workshop in Cambridge, England. Having never stepped foot in Greece, we thought Santorini would be a great place to spend the weekend. Getting off on JTR, I was immediately hit with chaotic airport layouts, confused tourists hanging around the place, and Greek bussers that couldn't care less if you’re having a nice day. Dropping in a 2 euro coin, I headed straight towards Thera and Akrotiri for the first night.

Akrotiri is a local village in Greece that houses less of the chaotic, Instagrammer-going tourist crowd. It was pleasantly quiet as I enjoyed a traditional Greek stew dinner and listened to a nearby band playing away the night…

One of the reasons why I wanted to visit Akrotiri was its archaeological ruins. The next morning, I trekked down to Ancient Akrotiri, a former Ancient Greek city that succumbed to Pompeii's disastrous fate.

In the afternoon, I arrived in Perissa to tour the Black Sand Beach, but I wanted to hike towards Ancient Thera. Along the hike, a tempered chapel sat midway between Ancient Thera and Perissa.

Temporarily seeking refuge from the sun on a hot afternoon, I quickly got up and hustled toward the top for a panoramic view of Santorini. Ancient Thera, a UNESCO site, depicted a civilization at its height and showcased the many wonders of life during the Hellenic periods. The preservation of the ruins represents a stark dichotomy between the airport I just flew into and the remarkable history just a few steps from the touristy center of Thera.

**Favorite Food Alert**: Souvlaki. The pork souvlakis were cheap and perfect snack-sized bites for adventuring on the Greco Islands. The honorable mention was the Rizogalo gelato.

## Portugal O' Portugal

The best parts of Portugal were the egg tarts (pastel de nata), the seafood (seafood rice), the weather, the Moorish architecture, the people, the cost of living, and the entire country. Nina was on her way marching down the coast of Portugal, and I had to swing by to say hi. 

<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/2a/2_pastel.jpeg">

One of the UNESCO sites we toured was Castle Peña. In Castle Peña, Nina and I witnessed noble life from long ago. Here, Castle Peña was situated on an unusually high mountain, but the views would have been breathtaking if it weren’t for the fires occurring in the Porto region of the country. Pastel-yellow walls and tiles embellished the old castle with all the flair and character of nobility from the 1600s.

One of the more breathtaking parts of the city was the art district and the area by the port. Here, brushing up against the coastal humidity and the bustling tourism, a quiet melody from a steel drum wandered the granite sidewalks until they hit our ears. Here, Nina and I confirmed that we felt at ease and happy for the first time in the past 4 days. Rare moments like these have placed Portugal on my must-revisit destinations for another time!

**Favorite Food Alert**: THERE IS TOO MANY, but if I had to pick one, it would be this egg pound cake roll. I’m not sure what it is called, but I am craving this as I am furiously typing up this post…

## Lavaux Vineyards

I briefly stopped by to visit Stijn and his colleagues on my trek across Southern Europe. I initially planned to stay in Switzerland longer but wanted to give Bene time to recoup… But Lausanne was different, unlike other European cities I’ve been to so far. The Lausanne airport felt like a premium travel destination in the 1980s, with the accented colors and vinyl-like feel from that era. 

<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/2a/2_lausanne.jpeg">

Nonetheless, I continued my trek outside the airport into the Lauvaux wine region, famous for its wines that get their acidity from the hard glacial water that carved Lake Lausanne. One morning, I decided to stroll on the Lauvaux tour, witness the miles and miles of vineyards, maybe eat one grape (the best I’ve ever had), and take a ferry across the lake.

Lausanne was kind of it if Europe felt like what Europe was described to me growing up. The rolling mountains in the background, the crystal blue lake, and the overall poshness associated with Swiss life were captured during my short stay in Lausanne. I will be back, however, so stay tuned on this front.

## Luxembourg City in November

When I arrived in Arlon, I panicked because I didn’t have my passport to cross the Luxembourg border. Given the recent election of right-wing governments, I have been told border inspections are now a regular occurrence. Thankfully, the travel juujuu has hit me just in time, I've made it to Luxembourg with no problems at the border. 

<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/2a/2_lux.jpeg">

Luxembourg itself was a tiny country I had to check off my to-visit list, and I'm glad it was a visit worth remembering. Though short, some of my favorite highlights for this trip were the UNESCO Casemates du Bock, a fortress envied for its prime location, the decadent carrot cake I had at an underground cafe while contemplating the future of America, the Modern Art Museum, and the rainbow tram. It was very short, but a very sweet trip!

Having been to a handful of European countries, my thoughts on comparing the US and European countries started to emerge. Strong thoughts on this are emerging, and I will lay them bare in another post. In summary, as I make my way across the continent, there is much to be proud of about the US and the European way of life. Broad generalizations of both continents often lead to unfair comparisons. There is much to admire and complain about these two global entities.

## What does roast chicken and Brugge have in common?

The busy month of October continues with a short visit by my amazing friend from college, Karley, and her mom, Denise. One of the trip highlights was our day trip to Brugge. Our morning started with us wandering the brick-laden corridors of Brugge, eating a delicious Belgian waffle, and conversing with a group of schoolchildren learning English. I’m surprised the group of kids were able to find the Americans amongst the crowd, and what’s even more shocking for them is their encounter with three individuals from Michigan, Minnesota, and Hawaii. 

<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/2a/2_karley.jpeg">

On a random Wednesday, we passed by a farmers' market that sold flowers, cheese, meats, and roast chicken, all in the town square. We were all hungry and decided to get a roast chicken. Denise was prepared; being the mom of 4, she brought out the hand wipes, the appetizers, and chocolate and ensured Karley and I were cared for before we kept strolling along in the city. As per usual, I was busy stuffing my face while gossiping with Denise, all under the gorgeous setting of Brugge.

Minnewater Park was another one of our favorite attractions in the city. The waterway, floral arrangements, and chilly air marking the end of summer all made this moment so much more enjoyable and picturesque. I am thankful for these two who came out all the way from the Midwest to say hi! Come back again, please! :)
