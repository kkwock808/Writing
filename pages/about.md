Kevin W.C. Kwock is currently an exchange researcher in the Photonics Research Group at Ghent University, Belgium. Having spent most of his life in the United States, living in Hawai'i, New Mexico, Ohio, and New York, Kevin is over the moon about his exchange program in Ghent, Belgium. Cheers to this bumbling American as he embarks on adventures and learning experiences that he will never forget.
